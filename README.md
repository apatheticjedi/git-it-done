## Description

This is a project that was completed in class. It was designed to gain experience in server-side APIs and fetch requests. The application uses GitHub's API to find repos by GitHub username to see which ones have open issues. Users can filter results by 3 coding languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). [View the deployed application here](https://apatheticjedi.github.io/git-it-done/).
